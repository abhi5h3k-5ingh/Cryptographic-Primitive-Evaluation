# Cryptographic-Primitive-Evaluation
Evaluation of performance of various cryptographic algorithm.

I have evaluated and compared the computational, communication, and storage cost of the following cryptographic algorithms for encryption and/or authentication. The computational cost refers to the time (in msec) to execute the algorithm, the communication cost refers to the length (in bits) of the packet communicated from the sender to the receiver in the algorithm, and the storage cost refers to the length (in bits) of the key that needs to be securely stored in this algorithm.
